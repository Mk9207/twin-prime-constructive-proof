🌐 Overview | 概要

This repository presents a constructive proof of the Twin Prime Conjecture, which asserts:

“There exist infinitely many prime pairs (p, p + 2).”


本リポジトリは「2 道の絶対数が無限に存在する」という双値素数予想に対して、69行の構成的証明を依存性なく提示します。

Key proof strategies include:

A-type prime classification: All primes expressed as 

Elimination function  to rule out non-prime and non-twin cases

Infinite construction via block expansion

AI-assisted formal lemma modeling

🧠 Constructive Features

Filtered Construction

Primes are generated by explicit construction, eliminating composite forms.


Block Analysis

Proofs are divided into logical blocks that capture twin patterns.


Elimination Functions

Structures like  remove invalid pairs and ensure twinness.


Formal Lemmas

Proof rigor is reinforced by modular lemmas and logical induction.
